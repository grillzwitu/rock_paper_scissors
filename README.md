# CMD ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules.  
This project is a simple demonstration of the use of python modules as well as loops.

## A brief summary

Scissors beats Paper
